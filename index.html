  <p>Born November 7, 1918, four days before the Armistice ended World War I, Mr. Graham was reared on a dairy farm in Charlotte, N.C. Growing up during the Depression, he learned the value of hard work on the family farm, but he also found time to spend many hours in the hayloft reading books on a wide variety of subjects.</p>
  <p>In the fall of 1934, at age 15, Mr. Graham made a personal commitment to Christ through the ministry of Mordecai Ham, a traveling evangelist, who visited Charlotte for a series of revival meetings.</p>
  <p>Ordained in 1939 by Peniel Baptist Church in Palatka, Fla. (a church in the Southern Baptist Convention), Mr. Graham received a solid foundation in the Scriptures at Florida Bible Institute (now Trinity College of Florida). In 1943 he graduated from Wheaton College in Illinois and married fellow student Ruth McCue Bell, daughter of a missionary surgeon, who spent the first 17 years of her life in China.</p>
    <p>Billy Graham is beloved by many Americans today. He is an icon in the church and a great influence in his time. He has served the Lord faithfully winning countless souls over to Jesus Christ.<p>
    <p>There is no doubt that when Billy Graham does pass into glory, there will be a void left in the American Church and to countless Christians around the world.</p>
